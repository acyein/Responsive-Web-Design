                <li>
                    Temple Grandin helped break down years of shame and stigma as one of the first adults to publicly disclose that she was autistic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Temple's ability to convey to the reader her innermost feelings and
                    fears, coupled with her capacity for explaining mental processes will give the reader an insight into autism that very few have been able to achieve.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Based on personal experience, Grandin advocates early intervention to address autism and supportive teachers, who can direct fixations of the child with autism in fruitful directions.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                She has described her hypersensitivity to noise and other sensory stimuli. She says words are her second language and that she thinks "totally in pictures", using her vast visual memory to translate information into a mental slideshow of images that may be manipulated or correlated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grandin attributes her success as a humane livestock facility designer to her ability to recall detail, which is a characteristic of her visual memory. Grandin compares her memory to full-length movies in her head, that may be replayed at will, allowing her to notice small details. She also is able to view her memories using slightly different contexts by changing the positions of the lighting and shadows.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a proponent of neurodiversity, Grandin does not support eliminating autism genes or treating mildly-autistic individuals. However, she believes that autistic children who are severely handicapped need therapy with applied behavioral analysis. Additionally, she has claimed that she only will attend talks given by autistics who can hold down a career.

                    I think using animals for food is an ethical thing to do, but we've got to do it right. We've got to give those animals a decent life, and we've got to give them a painless death. We owe the animals respect.
